  Together, with Aneese, Carter and Timothy, I will help create a simple video-game in a similar light to '_The Binding of Isaac_', using Unreal Engine 4. We expect to complete this project by using our background knowledge of C++ (to which Unreal Engine 4 is similar to), and by trying our best to learn as much as we can about the engine. My specific role within the project will be to design the framework of how the game will funcion structurally, and to design its levels.

  Together, with Aneese, Carter, and Timothy, the basics of the story, characters, and setting were chosen. We also decided on a title. The game will be called Outcast, and feature a mysterious black alien as he attempts to escape from captivation in a myserious scientific institute. The ending of the game will focus on a moral choice between killing the captors, or killing your alien friend who killed some captors to help you get as far as you have. Finally, a sprite of the main character from 4 different angles was created to initiate the creation of our game.

    There was no physical progress made on my end in terms of the development of the game, however I did spent some time trying to familiarize myself with the basics of Unreal Engine 4 by watching and programming along to a few video tutorials. Using this knowledge I plan to begin the creation of our games's levels, and it's music next week.
