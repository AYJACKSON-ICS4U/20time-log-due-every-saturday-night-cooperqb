  Together, with Aneese, Carter and Timothy, I will help create a simple video-game in a similar light to '_The Binding of Isaac_', using Unreal Engine 4. We expect to complete this project by using our background knowledge of C++ (to which Unreal Engine 4 is similar to), and by trying our best to learn as much as we can about the engine. My specific role within the project will be to design the framework of how the game will funcion structurally, and to design its levels.
