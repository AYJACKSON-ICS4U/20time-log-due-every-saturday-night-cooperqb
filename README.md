  Together, with Aneese, Carter and Timothy, I will help create a simple video-game in a similar light to '_The Binding of Isaac_', using Unreal Engine 4. We expect to complete this project by using our background knowledge of C++ (to which Unreal Engine 4 is similar to), and by trying our best to learn as much as we can about the engine. My specific role within the project will be to design the framework of how the game will funcion structurally, and to design its levels.

  Together, with Aneese, Carter, and Timothy, the basics of the story, characters, and setting were chosen. We also decided on a title. The game will be called Outcast, and feature a mysterious black alien as he attempts to escape from captivation in a myserious scientific institute. The ending of the game will focus on a moral choice between killing the captors, or killing your alien friend who killed some captors to help you get as far as you have. Finally, a sprite of the main character from 4 different angles was created to initiate the creation of our game.

    There was no physical progress made on my end in terms of the development of the game, however I did spent some time trying to familiarize myself with the basics of Unreal Engine 4 by watching and programming along to a few video tutorials. Using this knowledge I plan to begin the creation of our games's levels, and it's music next week.

  This week I designed a few different mechanics for our game, including room types, and power ups. The room types include long battle rooms, regular battle rooms, shop rooms (rooms where you can buy items), boss rooms (rooms where you fight bosses), and power up rooms (rooms where you can receive bonus power ups at the expense of maximum health). I also designed a few different offensive and defensive power ups for the alien. These would include stat boosting power up for rate of fire, projectile size and damage, and projectile speed. Some other power ups include an activatable 0.5 second invinsibility power up, bonus health, projectiles which block damage, and an orbiting shield. My plan for next week will be to start programming basic rooms into unreal engine 4.

  This week I never ended up completing my goal of programming basic rooms into unreal engine, but I did spend some on creating the music for the game. I found a program that allows you to program retro styled chiptune songs, and so I began brainstorming some melodies for the game. Other than that, no other significant progress was made on the game.

    No progress was made on the game this week, as there was no allocated time to do so.
